# Climate suitability modeling study of Calonectria pseudonaviculata

Files in this repository replicate results presented in the climate suitability 
study of Calonectria pseudonaviculata, a fungal pathogen that causes boxwood blight.  
Repository contents include one R project, 11 R scripts, raw and
processed CliMond data used for modeling (27 variables), the full and 
subsampled occurrence record datasets used for modeling, and the CLIMEX 
outfiles. 

All correlative modeling anlayses are conducted within the 
project; however, the process-based CLIMEX model must be run within a 
stand-alone software program using parameters presented in the manuscript. 
The resulting maps and tables associated with correlative models may be slightly 
different than those presented in the manuscript due to random sampling of 
locations used for correlative models (both prior to and during modeling).

Subsetted occurrence records and formatted climate data are provided in this
repository; however, running the project will re-do the entire process
of creating these files using the full occurrence records dataset
(~/Records/Cps_locations_updated_Apr2021) and raw climate data (files in 
~/CliMond_raw). 

## Installation

Simply clone the repository and follow the instructions below.

## Usage

Open the R project "Cps_climSuit_modeling.Rproj" in RStudio and click on the 
"runner.R" script. Running this script will source nine auxillary scripts
that conduct correlative modeling anlayses and creates tables and maps of
model outputs produced by CLIMEX and correlatve modeling anlyses. 
The "runner.R" script can also be run from the command line using RScript.

The "Cps_model_functions.R" script has functions that are used by most 
of the 9 auxillary scripts. 

All files must remain in the exact same locations as the repository.
Do not delete the full occurrence dataset or raw CliMond data.

Output files produced by ENMTML will be saved to a folder in "~/ENMTML/Outfiles/" 
that has the date that the model was run. Currently models are produced using
both a subset of CliMond variables (5 variables) and a PCA-transformed dataset
of the full CliMond dataset (27 variables). 

All figures (maps) of model outputs will be saved to a folder named "~/Final_figures"

Please read the comments within each R script for further clarity on the process.
